## 👩🏼‍💻 Features 
- **Product Listing** – Displays products dynamically from a JSON API.  
- **Product Details Page** – View detailed information about each product.  
- **Shopping Cart** – Add/remove products and update quantities.  
- **Local Storage Support** – Cart data persists even after page refresh.  
- **Order Processing** – Users can complete orders and see a confirmation page.  
- **Responsive Design** – Fully optimized for mobile and desktop. 

## ⭐ Usage
1️⃣ Browse Products – On the homepage, users can view a list of products, each displaying an image, title, price, and an "Add to Cart" button. Clicking on a product redirects to the Product Details Page, where users can see more information.

2️⃣ Add Products to Cart – Users can add products by clicking the "Add to Cart" button. A toast notification confirms the addition, and the shopping cart icon updates to show the total number of items.

3️⃣ View and Manage Cart – Clicking the cart icon takes users to the Shopping Cart Page, where they can see all added products, adjust quantities using + and - buttons, or remove items from the cart. The total price updates dynamically.

4️⃣ Place an Order – On the cart page, users can proceed by clicking "Complete Order", which clears the cart and redirects them to an Order Confirmation Page, displaying a success message.

5️⃣ Continue Shopping – After completing an order, users can return to the homepage and start shopping again. The cart resets, ensuring a fresh start for new purchases.

## 🧠 What I Learned

During the development of this project, I gained valuable experience and deepened my understanding of the following concepts:

1️⃣ State Management with Redux Toolkit – Implemented Redux to manage global state, including cart functionality, quantity updates, and local storage persistence.

2️⃣ Dynamic Routing with React Router – Used React Router to navigate between different pages such as Product Details, Shopping Cart, and Order Confirmation.

3️⃣ Tailwind CSS for Styling – Leveraged Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern UI design, ensuring a consistent layout across devices.

4️⃣ Local Storage Integration – Persisted cart data using localStorage to retain user selections even after page refresh.

5️⃣ User Notifications with React-Toastify – Provided real-time feedback using toast notifications for cart actions like adding or removing products.



## ⏰ Future Updates

This project serves as a foundation for learning and experimenting with React and Redux Toolkit. Here are some ideas for future enhancements and updates:

- User Authentication & Accounts – Implement user sign-up, login, and profile management to provide a personalized shopping experience.

- Payment Gateway Integration – Implement secure payment options (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to allow users to complete purchases seamlessly.

- Admin Dashboard – Create an admin panel for managing products, orders, and customer interactions.

- Product Reviews & Ratings – Allow users to leave reviews and ratings on products for better customer engagement.

- Wishlist & Favorites – Enable users to save products for later using a wishlist feature.

- Search & Filters – Add advanced filtering and sorting options to enhance product discovery.

- Multi-Language Support – Implement localization to make the app accessible to users in different languages.
